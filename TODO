This list is old and not updated, first take a look at
https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/gnome-disk-utility/-/issues/
and https://wiki.gnome.org/Apps/Disks

 - For optical drives, replace "Create Disk Image…" with "Burn Image to Disc…"
   - Also wanted: "Blank Disc…" dialog
   - Part of this involves deciding on library / command-line tools to use

 - Partition resizing
   - for the udisks part, see https://bugs.freedesktop.org/show_bug.cgi?id=51783

 - Btrfs support
   - https://bugzilla.gnome.org/show_bug.cgi?id=608204

 - Filesystem Checking
   - https://bugzilla.gnome.org/show_bug.cgi?id=676555

 - badblocks(8) functionality
   - Menu item: "Test Disk…" dialog
   - Basically, a way to do a burn-in test when you buy new disks
     - e.g. badblocks -wsv /dev/sdb
   - Avoid modal dialogs so multiple tests can run in parallel
   - After confirmation (and explanation of the feature), launches a local
     job that runs forever. Output of the job would be

      [===============>--- Testing Disk: 23.1% complete ------------------] [X]
      Pass 33: Testing with pattern 0xaa — 0 errors — 2 days, 5 hours elapsed

   - When a new pass is over, the progress bar starts at 0% again

 - Integrate with systemd's journal
   - make it possible to easily view all log messages related to a device
     - e.g. journalctl /dev/sda
       - does this also cover messages in layers below the block layer?
   - show exclamation icon in device tree-view and a cluebar if there are
     _important_ and _unread_ messages
     - define "important" (warning and above?)
     - define "unread" (does the systemd journal have such a concept?)
       - Disks will consume the journal APIs through (page-based?) D-Bus
         interfaces in udisks so maybe we can put the concept of "unread"
         into that
   - make udisks log messages to the systemd journal
   - with this in place, we can completely do away with modal error dialogs
     - why? because udisksd will have logged an error message to the journal
       - huge win

 - Historical SMART values
   - Like http://people.freedesktop.org/~david/smart-graph-temperature.png
     - rightmost third is linear (covering 24 hours)
     - leftmost two thirds are logarithmic (covering 100 days)
   - We also want small arrows in the list-view to convey the trend of
     a value over, say, the last week, e.g.

                               | Value       | Normalized   | Worst | Threshold
     Reallocated Sector Count  | ↑ 2 sectors | ↓ 99         | 99    | 50

 - Improve "Format Disk…" dialog so partitions can be created
   - Size is adjusted through a slider
   - Need designer input
   - Might be hard to do with current GTK+

 - Encryption Recovery Key
   - When setting up an encrypted device, it should be possible to create
     a "recovery key" that the user can either print or store in a safe
     place somewhere
     - LUKS already supports multiple keys
   - for a similar OS X feature see:
